    "# The Multi-Layer Perceptron\n",
    "Any neural network is simply a series of perceptrons feeding into one another. The perceptrons are arranged in layers with the outputs of a previous layer being the inputs into the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind it seems that we did much of the heavy lifting in the [first part](./01. The Perceptron.ipynb) concerning the percepton - the single neuron emultating unit that is the building block of a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we will consider the simplest case of a fully-connected network. That is a network where each node (percepton) in a given layer is connected to every node in the subsequent layer. This means that the output of a perceptron in the first layer will therefore be an input into each perceptron in the next layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similarly to the case of the vanilla perceptron we considered before the values passed as inputs to each layer will have weights associated with them. These weights will be the variables which we will vary as part of the training process with the ultimate goal of loss minimisation."
